# East Essex Hackspace NeoPixel Hexpansion

## Introduction
The app controls the NeoPixels on the East Essex Hackspace NeoPixel Hexpansion.

## How to get one?
You will unfortunately have to wait until EMF 2026, all 210 we made sold out during EMF 2024. Thanks to all that purchased one, all profits went to East Essex Hackspace for some (currently undecided) fancy new tools!

## Using the App
The main menu has the following items:

* Power - turn the LEDs on/off
* Speed - change the speed of the effects
* Brightness - change the overall master brightness
* Effects - choose an effect pattern
* Palette - choose a colour palette
* Main Slot - select the slot an EEH NeoPixel hexpansion has been plugged into.
* Mirror Slot - select the second slot an EEH NeoPixel hexpansion has been plugged into this mirrors the effects on the main slot.
* About - Shows the version and other info

## TODO

- [x] Implement GPIO communication with the hexpansion once the badge firmware allows
- [ ] Add more effects
- [ ] Add support for the buttons
